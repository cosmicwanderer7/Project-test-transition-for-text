            <div class="content__text"> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The big bang is how astronomers explain the way the universe began.
                                    
              In 1927, an astronomer named Georges Lemaître had a idea.
                       He said that a very long time ago, the universe started as just a single point. 
                       He said the universe stretched and expanded to get as big as it is now, and that it could 
                       keep on stretching over 13.8 billion years.
                       Just two years later, an astronomer named Edwin Hubble noticed that other galaxies were moving away from us. And that’s not all. 
                       The farthest galaxies were moving faster than the ones close to us.<br>
                       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  When the universe began, it was just hot, tiny particles mixed with light and energy. It was nothing like what we see now. As everything expanded and took up more space, it cooled down.
                       The tiny particles grouped together. They formed atoms. Then those atoms grouped together. Over lots of time, atoms came together to form stars and galaxies.
                       The first stars created bigger atoms and groups of atoms. That led to more stars being born. At the same time, galaxies were crashing and grouping together. As new stars were being born and dying, then things like asteroids, comets, planets, and black holes formed!
                       That’s pretty much how the universe began. Because it got so big and led to such great things, some people call it the "Big Bang."
